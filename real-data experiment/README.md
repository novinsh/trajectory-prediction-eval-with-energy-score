This directory only contains the results of the experiment.
The errors calculated from FDE, ADE, and ES for each model are stored as `.pkl` files, and `analyze_results.py` can be used to compile tables and visualizations that put together all results.

The actual code for the experiments can be found [here](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/real-data-experiment-13CF).
