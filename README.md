# Trajectory Prediction Evaluation via Energy Score

**Paper Title**: Distribution-aware Evaluation of Multimodal Trajectory Predictions with Energy Score
8th Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data (AALTD) at ECML-PKDD 2023


**Abstract**: Trajectory Prediction has received much attention in recent years due to the deployment of autonomous vehicles in real-world scenarios. With it, many works have addressed challenges in producing more reliable trajectory predictions. While modeling and representation of trajectory prediction have evolved to address its spatiotemporal complexities, its evaluation has primarily remained primitive. The most current methods provide rich probabilistic spatiotemporal outputs. However, the evaluation metrics used to assess such rich outputs evaluate limited aspects of the predictive distribution, making evaluation and comparison of models uninformative and sometimes even misleading. We propose using the Energy Score as a distribution-aware alternative to frequently used metrics in the trajectory prediction literature, such as minFDE and minADE. Energy Score is a strictly proper scoring rule more commonly known and used in the forecasting community. We present the formulation of the energy score for spatiotemporal data and showcase its theoretical capabilities through preliminary empirical results supporting our proposal. By introducing the energy score as an alternative evaluation metric for trajectory predictions, we aim to enhance the assessment of trajectory prediction models and foster more informative and reliable comparisons among different approaches.
